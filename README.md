This database was created for those who have a love of the Supernatural/Paranormal! The database takes in information to be a collective on Creatures, Encounters had with said Creatures, and the Locations these creatures were seen in and the Encounters that happened there! We used Trello to track and split up work according to database Tables. To plan the whole API out, we used Google Docs, more specifically, the planning document that was given to us.
